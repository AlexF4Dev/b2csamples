        <p>Demonstrates the use of a single Azure AD B2C tenant as authentication service for a SaaS application.</p>
        <p>
            A SaaS application commonly uses the concept of a <b>tenant</b> to group users whose use of the application
            are totally separated from use by any other groups. For example, a SaaS application may provide accounting
            services. Each business using the application is considered a tenant in the application. To distinguish such a tenant
            from Azure AD tenants, this application uses the term <b>application tenant</b>. (Azure AD is also a SaaS application, hence it
            also has the concept of a tenant).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sample an individual can either <a href="~/home/newtenant">create</a> a new application tenant or <a href="/home/membersignin">
            sign in</a> to existing tenants.
            Each application tenant has a short name and (optional) description. In order to sign in or sign up to existing tenants
            users will need to provide the short name of the application tenant. After signin, the application receives an
            OpenIDConnect id token with, among others, the application tenant's unique internal id (guid), name and user's role (admin or member;
            tenant creators are automatically assigned admin role, everybody else is a member). This data allows the application
            to make the appropriate authorization and data separation decisions. In this app, all the claims recived in the token
            are displayed on this page.
